	Hello, my name is Fatima Enriquez and this is my website. While it may not be <b> a d v a n c e d </b>, I made this for fun and to grow my programming skills. I am a current undergraduate student at the University of California San Diego where I am majoring in Cognitive Science with a specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation! At the moment, I am eager to get my foot in the door with all things software. I have knowledge in Python and Java; yet, I have dabbled with C++, CSS, and HTML.
